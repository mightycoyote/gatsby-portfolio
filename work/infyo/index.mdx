## Intro

This was the first project I built after completing a basic frontend web developer curriculum online. I was keen to build an original site of my own, as well as try out Tailwind and a JavaScript framework. There are a lot of things I'd do differently now, but the site still works: it's accessible and fully responsive.

## React

I'd done a React basics course, and had the official documentation close to hand, but didn't understand it nearly as well as I do now (I recommend [Josh Comeau's "The Joy of React"](https://www.joyofreact.com/).) Overkill for such a simple site? Maybe. On the other hand, at the time at least, the tooling for `create-react-app` worked pretty well and I was able to find effective answers to questions like how to get Tailwind installed and how to build and deploy to Github Pages. Since then, I've built several one-off practice projects (mostly through [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/mightycoyote)) using what should have been simpler tools, but sometimes had a lot of problems configuring them from outdated, patchy, or nonexistent documentation.

Also, I'm not really sorry I dipped my toes in React that early.
